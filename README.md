# uConsole QMK Keyboard Firmware

This repository provides a streamlined, standalone QMK firmware distribution specifically optimized for the **ClockworkPi uConsole**.

Unlike the standard QMK repository, this project isolates the uConsole keyboard logic. By removing unrelated drivers and keyboard definitions, provide a lightweight environment dedicated to perfecting the uConsole typing experience.

## 🎯 Project Goals

* **Clean Workspace:** Only contains code relevant to the uConsole keyboard.
* **Minimal Context:** Makes it easy to identify specific hardware changes and logic.
* **Rapid Development:** Faster compile times and easier testing of experimental QMK features.
* **Streamlined CI/CD:** Simple workflows for rebuilding and releasing binaries.
* **Low Barrier to Entry:** Easier for community members to contribute layouts without learning the entire QMK ecosystem.

## 🧪 Keyboard Tester

Test your uConsole keyboard layout and functionality with our interactive keyboard tester:

**[https://j1n6.github.io/qmk-uconsole/](https://j1n6.github.io/qmk-uconsole/)**

This web-based tool provides:
* **Visual Feedback:** See which keys are being pressed in real-time
* **Layer Detection:** Shows Layer 2 (Fn) key combinations
* **D-Pad & Gamepad Testing:** Test arrow keys, joystick buttons (X, Y, A, B), and mouse buttons (L, R, Middle)
* **Scroll & Cursor Tracking:** Visualize trackball movement and scroll events

Perfect for verifying your firmware installation and familiarizing yourself with the uConsole's unique keyboard layout!

## 🎹 Special Key Behaviors

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Keyboard Locale / OS Layout:** This firmware expects the host operating system's keyboard layout to be set to **US English (ANSI)**. If your OS is configured with a different layout, some key outputs—specifically special characters and tap-hold keys—might not display correctly or map to different symbols.

* **Remapped A/B/X/Y in keyboard mode:**

Game mode can be activited & toggled by `Fn`+`G`. Gamepad function is mapped to the following table:

| Key    | Gamepad mode    | Keyboard mode
|--------|-----------------|--------------
| A      | `JS_0` (A)      | Execute (`KC_EXECUTE`)
| B      | `JS_1` (B)      | Stop    (`KC_STOP`)
| X      | `JS_2` (X)      | System Request (`KC_SYSTEM_REQUEST`)
| Y      | `JS_3` (Y)      | Menu    (`KC_MENU`)
| Select | `JS_4` (Select) | Select  (`KC_SELECT`)
| Start  | `JS_5` (Start)  | Super   (`KC_LEFT_GUI`)

* **Gamepad mode:** Press **Fn+(X)** or Fn+any gamepad key

* **Factory Reset:** Press **Fn+Fn** to reset EEPROM to factory defaults

* **Trackball Scrolling:** Hold the **Select** key and move the trackball to scroll.
    * Move Up/Down for Vertical Scroll
    * Move Left/Right for Horizontal Scroll

### D-Pad & Directional Keys
The physical directional keys change functions based on the active mode:

| Active Mode | Modifier Held | D-Pad Function |
|---|---|---|
| **Keyboard** (Layer 0) | None | Standard arrow keys (`Up`, `Down`, `Left`, `Right`) |
| **Keyboard** (Layer 0) | `Y` or `B` Button | Mouse cursor movement (quick trackball alternative) |
| **Gamepad** (Layer 2) | None | Virtual joystick axes (X and Y axes) |

### Trackball & Cursor Settings
Advanced trackball features are accessed by holding the **Select** key:

| Action | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Hold `Select` + Move Trackball** | Trackball Scrolling | Move Up/Down for vertical, Left/Right for horizontal scroll |
| **Hold `Select` + Click Trackball** | Precision Cursor Mode | Toggles between normal and precision (reduced) cursor speeds |

### System & Feature Toggles
Use the following shortcuts to toggle hardware modes and special features:

| Shortcut / Key Combo | Function | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **`Fn` + `G`** | Gamepad Mode | Toggles Layer 2 (maps A/B/X/Y and D-Pad for gaming) |
| **`Fn` + `T` + `H`** | Tap-Hold Toggle | Turns tap-hold on/off (Default: **disabled**, saves to EEPROM) * |
| **Double-Tap Letter**| Quick Duplication| Quickly produces two lowercase characters (e.g. `aa`) |
| **`LAlt`+`RAlt`+`Start`**| DFU Mode | Enters bootloader mode for firmware flashing |

*\* Note: In the `clockworkpi_uconsole_no_tap_hold.bin` build, the tap-hold feature is completely compiled out, so `Fn+T+H` does nothing.*

## 🎯 Installation Guide

**⚠️ WARNING:**
Don't install a firmware image without another input method, like an external
keyboard or SSH connection, or you won't have any way to fix it if it fails.
The uConsole keyboard is an independent USB device, so even if it has issues
the rest of the unit is unaffected.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the necessary tools installed on your uConsole:

1. **Install DFU utilities:**
   ```sh
   sudo apt install -y dfu-util
   ```

On musl libc Linux systems, you have to install gcompat first for the upload script to work. On Alpine or postmarketOS, this can be done via `sudo apk add gcompat`.

2. **Download the original stock firmware package:**
   ```sh
   wget https://github.com/clockworkpi/uConsole/raw/master/Bin/uconsole_keyboard_flash.tar.gz
   tar zxvf uconsole_keyboard_flash.tar.gz
   cd uconsole_keyboard_flash
   ```

3. **Download the latest QMK firmware:**
   - Go to [Releases](https://github.com/j1n6/qmk-uconsole/releases)
   - Download the firmware binary file of your choice:
     - **`clockworkpi_uconsole_default.bin`**: Standard full-featured firmware (includes the tap-hold toggle feature).
     - **`clockworkpi_uconsole_no_tap_hold.bin`**: Simplified firmware with the tap-hold feature completely disabled/compiled out.
   - Move the downloaded `.bin` file to the `uconsole_keyboard_flash` folder. *(Note: If you download the `no_tap_hold` build, replace `clockworkpi_uconsole_default.bin` with `clockworkpi_uconsole_no_tap_hold.bin` in the flashing commands below.)*

---

### Option 1: First-Time Flash from Stock Firmware

If you're upgrading from the original ClockworkPi firmware:

1. **Edit the upload script for better reliability:**
   
   Open `maple_upload` and change all delay values from `750` to `1500` milliseconds. This prevents "serial port not ready" errors.

2. **Flash the firmware:**
   ```sh
   sudo ./maple_upload ttyACM0 2 1EAF:0003 clockworkpi_uconsole_default.bin
   ```
---

### Option 2: Upgrade from Existing QMK Firmware

If you already have QMK installed and want to update:

1. **Run the DFU utility:**
   ```sh
   sudo dfu-util -w -d 1eaf:0003 -a 2 -D clockworkpi_uconsole_default.bin -R
   ```

2. **Enter bootloader mode:**
   
When dfu-util says `waiting for device, exit with ctrl-C`, press **Left Fn** and **Right Fn**.

After installing the QMK firmware, the bootloader has a 2-3 second window for
uploading firmware. Otherwise it will verify the existing firmware and continue
to function normally.

### 🆘 Recovery: Unbricking Your Keyboard

In some rare cases, the keyboard will have entered the DFU mode, but the
firmware won't have flashed and the keyboard won't respond to input. If this
happens, try rebooting the operating system and repeating the flashing steps.

If the keyboard remains non-functional, don't panic! Follow these steps:

1. **Connect the micro-USB cable** from your uConsole to the keyboard

2. **Enter bootloader mode:**
   - Locate the **S1 pin** on the keyboard PCB
   - Short the S1 pin (you'll see a green LED flash)

3. **Flash the stock firmware:**
   ```sh
   cd uconsole_keyboard_flash
   sudo ./flash
   ```
   
   **Note:** You may need to try this several or many times.

4. **Verify:** Once successful, your keyboard should be responsive again. You can then re-flash QMK if needed.

### Improving Keypress & Backlight
A custom keyboard diffuser design is available to improve the keypress responsiveness & lighting, details can be [found here](https://jing.io/projects/uconsole-keyboard-diffuser/). Most importantly, you are able to fast type on the small keyboard!

### Improving Fit and Reducing Noise
If the trackball does not sit flush beneath the **uConsole** cover or exhibits slight mechanical "play," you can install a custom shim to tighten the fit. This modification eliminates internal gaps and significantly dampens the vibration noise generated when rolling the trackball against the metal chassis.
* **Download:** **[Trackball Shim STL](https://github.com/j1n6/qmk-uconsole/blob/main/images/TPU_Trackball_Shim.stl)**

* **Material Recommendation:** I highly recommend printing this part using **TPU** or another flexible filament. The elasticity of TPU provides the necessary grip to hold the module in place while acting as a shock absorber for a quieter user experience.
